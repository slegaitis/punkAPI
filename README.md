Glofox Test by T Slegaitis

To run:
1) Clone / Fork repo
2) npm install
3) npm start

Some of the things i didn't have time for:

1) Handle Rate
2) Notifications to show when same beer pulled or error occured
3) Never pull same beer (in random section)
4) Better tests :) 
5) 1 Of tests fails now because of Redux and async actions, didn't have enough time to fix it (Test fails because of jest set up not app being broken)
