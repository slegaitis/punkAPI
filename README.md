Simple PunkAPI app by T Slegaitis

Built with React and Redux

To run:
1) Clone / Fork repo
2) npm install
3) npm start

Some of the things i didn't have time for:

1) Handle Rate
2) Never pull same beer (in random section), achieved by keeping track of history of beers pulled in redux
3) Better tests :) 
4) 1 of tests fails now because of Redux and async actions, didn't have enough time to fix it (Test fails because of jest set up not app being broken)
5) Loading indication and some animations
